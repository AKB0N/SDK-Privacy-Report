# SDK-Privacy-Report
This repository is a community maintained & sourced documentation of privacy details of popular SDKs. Details include data collected/shared, purposes, tracking details which app developers can use to fill the privacy forms for Apple Privacy Nutrition & Google Safety Section.

## Overview
As a part of iOS 14 update, Apple made it mandatory for app developers to disclose privacy details of their apps, termed as Apple Privacy Nutritional Labels. Google also launched a similar app privacy disclosure requirement termed as Google Safety Section. Both of these initiatives benefit consumers to easily see the privacy overview of an app before using it. While app developers know what data they collect, for third party SDKs it requires them to read multiple documentation, ask questions and spend a lot of time to know what to fill. This project is an attempt to save that time by creating a centralized documentation of privacy detail of all SDKs. We are starting with 24 SDKs with a goal to keep increasing the list and encourage the community to contribute to it. 

## Repository Structure
We have a CSV file and a Readme file for SDK privacy details of Apple & Google. For Apple, there is more documentation and we have relied on official documentation to create this list. For Google, we have used the documentation released for apple privacy labels to create this and will be updating as more google specific documentation is released by companies.
